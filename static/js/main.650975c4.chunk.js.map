<p>You can try to be quick, try to find the first star</p>\n        <p>at this time of night, no one knows where they are.</p>\n      </Stanza>\n\n      <Stanza background={stanzaBackgroundColor}>\n        <p>They pop one by one from the haze of the sky</p>\n        <p>This can be slow, good thing you have pie!</p>\n      </Stanza>\n\n      <Stanza background={stanzaBackgroundColor}>\n        <p>If

<p>It’s Cooling off poodles, and freshly baked strudels</p>\n        <p>And Cooling down noodles and brown labradoodles</p>\n      </Stanza>\n\n      <Stanza background={stanzaBackgroundColor}>\n

      <p>Then Cooling the fish at old carrigans hold</p>\n        <p>And Cooling the rungs of the ladder you hold</p>\n      </Stanza>\n\n      <Stanza background={stanzaBackgroundColor}>\n        <p>You can taste the last bit of the sun as it goes</p>\n        <p>They say all the red makes it taste like a rose. </p>\n        <p>See if you smell it someday with your nose.</p>\n
